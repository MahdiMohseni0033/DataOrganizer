# mask2polygon 

This repository contains code that aims to convert mask images generated by image segmentation models into polygons. The resulting polygons are saved in a JSON file and can be visualized for further analysis.
## requirement 

In order to use this code, you will need the following packages:

- OpenCV-Python
- NumPy
- JSON
You can install these packages using pip by running the following command:

``` 
pip install opencv-python numpy json 
```

## How to use 
To use this code, you need to provide the path to the mask image and the path and name of the JSON file where the resulting polygons will be saved. You can do this by modifying the appropriate variables in the code. Then, simply run the script and the resulting JSON file will be generated.

It's important to note that the mask image should be a binary image where each pixel corresponds to either the foreground (object of interest) or the background. The resulting polygons will represent the contours of the foreground object.

If you encounter any issues or have any questions, please feel free to open an issue in the repository.
